# webstudy
extension that blocks chrome access => study anki

FIX:
 - link to AnkiWeb
 - settings e.g. change background color, change study frequency, change # study cards
 - make the flip button on the back of the card work
 - close the study tab after its done
 - make it so the timer restarts after every chrome session - currently it starts a new study session asap after u open chrome


 - restore the tab the user was on that got changed into a lock down tab - DONE
